Corrects vertex indexing and variable naming for bisector calculations:

7090d0d70913ad8dd66840daa9f13832d5a87e0d,"Implement Delphi integration for CrossCoder interpretability (Issue #703)

This commit adds comprehensive integration with the Delphi interpretability library,
enabling advanced feature analysis for CrossCoder models.

Key features:
- CrossCoder adapters for Delphi compatibility (single and dual model)
- Modified latent cache supporting dual model activation collection
- Anthropic Batch API integration for 10-100x faster processing
- Token alignment and chat template handling for different architectures
- HTML visualizations with feature explanations and scores
- Configuration-driven pipeline with YAML inheritance

Components:
- src/crosscoder/delphi_integration/: Core integration modules
  - crosscoder_adapter.py: Adapters for Delphi's sparse coder interface
  - crosscoder_cache.py: Extended cache for dual model activations
  - batch_explainer.py: Batch API for efficient explanation generation
  - tokenization_bridge.py: Handles chat templates and alignment
- experiments/delphi_analysis/: Analysis pipeline and testing
- configs/delphi_analysis/: YAML configurations
- delphi/: Complete Delphi library included as subfolder

The integration processes millions of tokens efficiently, generates human-readable
explanations for features, and scores their quality using multiple metrics.

This commit replaces .netrc with uv environment variables for installing

The issue with .netrc files is that they are applied system-wide and are
scoped by hostname, meaning we can't differentiate tool repositories
requests from regular requests to CrewAI's API.

* Added is_auto_end flag in agentops.end session in crew.py (#1320)

When using agentops, we have the option to pass the `skip_auto_end_session` parameter, which is supposed to not end the session if the `end_session` function is called by Crew.

Now the way it works is, the `agentops.end_session` accepts `is_auto_end` flag and crewai should have passed it as `True` (its `False` by default). 

I have changed the code to pass is_auto_end=True

9431a4e2acb0458b26d4b5fe1f7f947a6d3ea813,"refactor: Modularize large files into focused subdirectories

Address code review feedback by breaking down large modules into smaller,
focused components for improved maintainability.

## Refactoring Changes

### PRISMA Package (knowledge_storm/prisma/)
- **models.py**: Core data structures (Paper, SearchStrategy, etc.)
- **search.py**: SearchStrategyBuilder for PICO methodology
- **screening.py**: ScreeningAssistant + PRISMAScreener (80/20 rule)
- **extraction.py**: DataExtractionHelper for systematic data extraction
- **reporting.py**: ZeroDraftGenerator for overcoming blank page syndrome
- **assistant.py**: Main PRISMAAssistant orchestrator
- **__init__.py**: Clean exports for external use

### VERIFY Package (knowledge_storm/verify/)
- **models.py**: Core data structures (Claim, VerificationResult, etc.)
- **fact_checker.py**: FactChecker for claim verification
- **memory.py**: ResearchMemory for learning patterns
- **fixer.py**: TargetedFixer for surgical corrections
- **system.py**: Main VERIFYSystem orchestrator
- **__init__.py**: Clean exports for external use

## Task Management Cleanup

- Simplified verbose `details` fields in tasks.json (725 → more readable)
- Moved implementation logs to `.taskmaster/logs/` for better organization
- Preserved essential task definitions while improving JSON readability
- Created backup of original tasks.json

## Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused modules easier to understand/modify
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Reusability**: Individual components can be imported as needed
- **Organization**: Clear separation of concerns across subdirectories
- **Documentation**: Each module has a specific, clear purpose

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing imports continue to work through __init__.py exports
- Updated test_verify_system.py to use new modular imports
- Original large files backed up as .bak files
- No breaking changes to external APIs

This commit deletes several obsolete scripts and migration files related to employee management, including:

- Removed `remove_max_employees.py` and `remove_min_employees.py` scripts, which were previously used for managing employee limits in the shifts table.
- Deleted the `SCHEDULER_ENHANCEMENTS.md` file, which contained outdated enhancement plans for the scheduler.
- Cleared the `TASKS.md` file, which was no longer relevant to the current task management approach.

b900ffc4490971f1b434b43e7f664284a267e4d7,"feat: Add beautiful rich-based logging system for orchestrator

## Overview
Replaced the previous ugly JSON log output with a comprehensive, structured logging system using the rich library for beautiful terminal output. This dramatically improves the developer experience when monitoring agent orchestration.

## Key Features Added

### 1. Rich-Based Logging Utilities (defog/llm/utils_logging.py)
- **OrchestrationLogger class**: Centralized logging with beautiful formatting
- **Rich console integration**: Colors, panels, tables, and trees for structured output
- **Global logger instance**: `orch_logger` available throughout the codebase

### 2. Comprehensive Logging Methods
- `log_request_start()`: Beautiful header with user request in styled panel
- `log_planning_analysis()`: Formatted analysis with automatic list detection and tree rendering
- `log_llm_call()`: Clean LLM provider/model logging with consistent styling
- `log_subagent_plans()`: Rich table showing agent configuration + individual task panels
- `log_task_execution_start()`: Task start with parallel/sequential mode indicators
- `log_task_execution_complete()`: Success/failure with result previews and metadata (tokens/cost)
- `log_retry_attempt()`: Retry progress with attempt counters and wait times
- `log_error_detail()`: Categorized error display with color-coded error types
- `log_orchestration_complete()`: Summary statistics table with totals

### 3. Orchestrator Integration (defog/llm/orchestrator.py)
- **Strategic logging placement**: Key orchestration events are logged with context
- **Request lifecycle tracking**: From initial request → planning → execution → completion
- **Error handling improvements**: Better error classification and logging
- **Null safety**: Fixed cost calculation errors when cost_in_cents is None

### 4. Visual Improvements
- **Color-coded status**: Green (success), red (error), yellow (warning), cyan (info)
- **Structured tables**: Agent configurations, statistics, and summaries
- **Rich panels**: Important information highlighted in bordered panels
- **Progress indicators**: Clear task execution flow with emojis and status
- **Error categorization**: Network, rate limit, auth, model, validation, server errors

### 5. Developer Experience Enhancements
- **Readable output**: No more raw JSON dumps cluttering the terminal
- **Context preservation**: Entity names, task IDs, and agent relationships are clear
- **Real-time monitoring**: Easy to follow agent orchestration progress
- **Debugging support**: Rich tracebacks and detailed error information

## Technical Details
- **Dependencies**: Added rich library for terminal rendering
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing logging.getLogger() calls still work
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead, rich output only when needed
- **Configurability**: Easy to adjust log levels and output formatting

## Before/After
**Before**: Raw JSON dumps with ugly, unstructured output
**After**: Beautiful, color-coded, hierarchical logging with tables, panels, and trees

This logging system transforms the developer experience from frustrating JSON parsing to intuitive, visual monitoring of complex agent orchestration workflows.
